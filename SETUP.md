# Instructions To Get Your Dev Environment Ready

## Install Python

1. go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install python 3
2. verify your python install by using  `python --version` or `python3 --version` from your shell.

## Install databases
Usually you will need to set up databases to develop your backend projects. Python comes with a lightweight database called SQLite which is good enough for our 101 demo, so you wonâ€™t need to set up a database for now.


## Install Django (Refer  [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release) for more details)
 1. Install Pip by using a standalone installer.  
	 - Download get-pip.py from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) or use curl:
 `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`
	 - Then run the following command in the folder where you have downloaded get-pip.py:
Unix/macOS:  `python get-pip.py` or `python3 get-pip.py`
Windows: `py get-pip.py`
2. Run `python -m pip install Django` to install Django



## Ta-da! Now you are done with your set up! We are all good to go!
